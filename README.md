# ⚡ Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my solutions and implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), written purely in **Python**.

The goal is to master algorithmic thinking, optimize code efficiency, and prepare for technical interviews.

### 📚 Topics Covered
* **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps, Trees (BST, AVL), Graphs, Heaps.
* **Algorithms:** Sorting (Merge, Quick, Heap), Searching (Binary Search), Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms.
* **Problem Solving:** Solutions to problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks.

### 🚀 Goal
To build a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals and write clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.
